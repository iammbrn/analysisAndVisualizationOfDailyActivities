    "In the Python code below, to perform the required task, I first created the 'LinkDatabase' class to create the database and perform various operations (creating a connection, creating a table, adding data, deleting data, fetching data, and closing the connection). Then, to retrieve data from the database and extract access links from URL information, I created the 'LinkExtractionFromDatabase' class, which inherits from the 'LinkDatabase' class. Additionally, I used a 'While' loop to perform these operations as many times as desired, allowing the user to perform their desired tasks within the loop until they press 'q' to terminate the program. Finally, I used 'Try' and 'Except' functions to show the user any errors that may occur while performing an operation."
